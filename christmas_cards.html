<p>I started creating Christmas cards at work one year, grabbing pictures from the year and putting them beside a narative poem to sum up what had been.  I've listed them below, though you'll note I went in a different direction for 2020, for what I feel are obvious reasons.

<h2>2020's Poem</h2>
</p>The Purloined Year<br>
<br>
Once upon an annus dreary, COVID masks would make us weary;<br>
altering international commerce as nothing had before.<br>
Strange hours kept working from home, catching colleagues only by phone;<br>
always staring, sometimes glaring ever trapped by our home decor.<br>
What is one more month or four?<br>
<br>
Authorities sometimes chasing, struggling with contract tracing;<br>
our well-being, items that freeing would be left at our front door.<br>
The curve was all ours to flatten, deliv'ry our waists did fatten;<br>
so much testing always vexing nasal swabs our poor brains did score.<br>
Please, ah sneeze, please no encore!<br>
<br>
The top man was not pastoral, a remedy electoral;<br>
many promoters to their voters, off their butts they would implore.<br>
All that night there was much counting, tension o'er the week was mounting;<br>
first one state, the left elate, many on all sides in uproar.<br>
Oration nothing like "four score".<br>
<br>
And now the end is upon us, for a vaccine there is great fuss;<br>
Christmas tiding brings distance subsiding, frequenting a bookstore.<br>
But now the year is behind me, with no sense of melancholy;<br>
it will forever, be my endeavour, to remember its lore.<br>
Speak "2020" nevermore.<br></p>
