<p>My wife had wanted one for a while. Her dad’s colleague’s Japanese wife had gotten one for her mom and it was amazing. The height of fashion. The epitome of chic. We were in the homeland, the neighbourhood, the proverbial “back yard”...so we were on a mission. Well she was, I didn’t have much else to do.</p>

<p>We were after a bag.</p>

<p>Just a handbag.</p>

<p>But not just a handbag, a Bao Bao bag. I’ll back up and explain.</p>

<p>Issey Miyake is a Japanese designer and, among other things, he designed this bag. Or rather this bag style. It comes in a range of colors and shapes but the common thread is that they are put together with little triangles of plastic, glued to a plastic mesh with small gaps between them so the bags can sit tastefully crumpled when at rest. At least that’s how it was explained to me, I never did take much notice of it.</p>

<p>These bags originate in Japan, unsurprisingly.  The bags we had seen in the wild (e.g. her mom’s) had come from Japan and been transported as gifts.  Despite the comprehensive trading of goods between everywhere and Australia you couldn’t get a Bao Bao bag Down Under.</p>

<p>But we were going to Japan.  We would go to the bag.</p>

<p>The first few days of the trip were pretty standard: arrive, figure out how to get our rail pass, figure out how to get to our first hotel, stay a bit, then figure out how to get the bullet train out of town and head to the mountains for a stay...the usual.</p>

<p>We had a lovely time, ate some fantastic food, saw some great sites...but in retrospect it all turned out to be merely prelude to the Bao Bao Odyssey.</p>

<p>We arrived back in Tokyo and had decided to set aside a day to the mission of getting a bag.  We knew it would be at least a bit of an ordeal because navigating around Japan, especially at the time, is no mean feat if you don’t read or speak Japanese.  The Japanese approach  to streets and addresses isn’t the easiest thing in the world to pick up.  We had some scribbled details we had cobbled together via internet research.  We had diligently cross checked those as best we could with a rail map.  We didn’t expect a phenomenally smooth enterprise.</p>

<p>But we didn’t have anything else to do.</p>

<p>What followed can only be described as an odyssey...well to be honest you could probably describe it in any number of ways, but per the title of this little piece, we’ll stick with odyssey.</p>

<p>I can’t remember exactly where the various locations we went to were so it won’t be possible to retrace our adventure, but that’ll probably just add to the mystique of it all (at least I’m hoping that’s the case because it’d be too much effort to try and do that research again).</p>

<p>With our rough plan in place, we set out first-ish thing in the morning and hopped onto the train we wanted and we were off.  It turns out that was only the train we thought we wanted, but this intrepid duo recovered quickly and we arrived at the stop we were after in a respectable span of time.</p>

<p>After a bit of wandering around we found the shop we were after.  Not a large location, but my wife’s reading of the store name decreed success.  I thought finding the place was going to be the problem, so with that solved I was already weighing up the merits of finding somewhere for lunch here or heading back to the heart of the city closer to our hotel and our ‘turf’.</p>

<p>I was so naive…</p>

<p>We walked into an empty store.</p>

<p>Not completely empty, there were two or three sales assistants there, ready to assist us with something.  That assistance wouldn’t take the form of sales though because the shelves were bare.  Not a bag or item for sale of any description.  The only thing to see on the shelves were little plastic signs with a camera icon and a line through it so we didn’t take any pictures.</p>

<p>The conversation that followed didn’t yield much information.  This was certainly off the beaten tourist track so the sales team wasn’t fluent in English.  They did suggest that there was another Issey Miyake store on that very street a few blocks away.  Perhaps we would have better luck there.</p>

<p>Back at home we might have requested they phone and ask the crucial question on our behalf...but they didn’t offer and with the language barrier we weren’t going to ask, and anyway what else were we going to do?</p>

<p>We hit the road fairly sure we could find our way back to the train station.</p>

<p>Second store, same result.  Several professional, polite assistants with nothing to sell us (there might have been a wallet or a watch in the display case, but really it was just as empty as the first place).  One of the staff was much more comfortable with English so after suggesting we try the store up the road (“sorry, we just came from there”) she sent us to the main department store district where several of the bigger department stores would have a little oasis of Issey Miyake products somewhere.</p>

<p>They didn’t tell us the bags had been discontinued.  We still didn’t know why there weren’t any bags anywhere, nor did we know why everyone seemed so casual about working in a shop with nothing to sell.</p>

<p>Would we ever find the answers to those questions?  Would we get a bag?  Would I get lunch in a timely fashion?  Let’s just say I had a lot on my mind as we walked back to the train station and headed for the belly of the Tokyo-consumer beast.</p>

<p>We’d been tipped off about a department store to try, and being very much on the beaten path finding it was a breeze.  Finding one counter within the very large department store proved more challenging.  We couldn’t split up to cover more ground because we didn’t have any way to communicate with each other our findings until we met up again.  So we did what any motivated couple would do.</p>

<p>We argued about which way we should go to start looking.</p>

<p>At this point I wasn’t yet gripped by the mystery and challenge of it all so I was a bit over the whole exercise.  As such I wasn’t super engaged in the search but that probably ended up being for the best as it meant I was just following her lead and we weren’t fighting (much) about which floor we should be on.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, from far across the floor there was a sign spotted and a resulting civilized dash in that direction.</p>

<p>Excitement building!  Expectation mounting!  Confusion exploding!</p>

<p>Not. A. Single. Thing.</p>

<p>Two well dressed sales assistants, some plastic signs telling us not to take pictures, the shelves the plastic signs telling us not to take pictures were sitting on, and the carpet the shelves were sitting on.</p>

<p>It was like the 15’ by 15’ square on the floor had been forgotten.  Like they sold almost every inch of the sales floor but the last patch and it was too late to do anything about it, but no one told the builders installing shelves.</p>

<p>Not much else to go on from the assistants, just the suggestion of trying the next department store over.  Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Now we were entering conspiracy territory, and I wanted answers!</p>

<p>Well, I was interested in the prospect of my wife talking to people and getting answers for me.  But that’s a level of investment in the situation I couldn’t have dreamed about earlier that day.</p>

<p>That’s right, with trains and walking this was going to be an exercise measured in days.  Maybe half a day if we wrapped it up quickly but we’d ticked over to days nonetheless.</p>

<p>Spoiler...it wouldn’t be quick (would have been a lame odyssey if it had).</p>

<p>We headed over to the next department store and found the spot pretty quickly.  But this time there was a feeling that we knew what to expect, and it matched our expectations perfectly.  Shelves: empty.  Little signs: displayed.  Sales assistants: polite.</p>

<p>But here ladies and gentlemen we had the first break in the case.  One assistant both spoke great English AND explained a little bit of what in the hell was going on!  Turns out any given store would get an unknown number of bags each morning and so when they were out they were out, try again tomorrow.  No explanation as to why this was the case, we filled in the blanks for ourselves along the lines of an unfortunate coincidence that they’re having supply shortages while we were there.</p>

<p>She suggested arriving before the department store opened at 10am.  We might see a line outside.  From there we would try our luck.  So we were very officially into the “days” territory now because we’d be at it the next day.</p>

<p>Now, I know a few things about getting into lines early for things (different stories that I might jot down sometime, hint: more than one Star Wars prequel…definitely measured in days) and so my thinking was clear: if we do this, we do it properly!</p>

<p>Department store opens at 10am...about a 10 minute walk from the hotel...round for a nice number, and...we should set the alarm for 6:30am.  And that’s what we did.  Not only that but I suggested on the walk over the next morning we circle the department store THEN get something for breakfast.  And it’s a good thing we did.</p>

<p>Because when we did that just before 7am we found a line already formed.</p>

<p>But that image doesn’t do justice to the scene.  I don’t want you to think that we happened upon two or three japanese women who’d interrupted an early morning walk to wait in line chatting to one another.  Oh no...it was so much more Japanese than that!</p>

<p>For starters, the line was signed...and roped off.  The signs were printed, laminated and in about five languages...and they didn’t just say “Issey Miyake”, it had the rules of the line:</p>
<p>No sitting</p>
<p>No holding someone else’s place in line</p>
<p>No eating</p>
<p>And so on</p>

<p>This was a serious deal.  The assistant the day before hadn’t prepared us for this at all!</p>

<p>My wife joined the line in spot 11.  10 other people had joined the line over 3 hours before the department store opened.  I went to go get supplies, and admittedly set us up to bend the line rules with the eating...but you might as well use the expectation that you’re an uncivilized tourist to your advantage every now and again am I right?</p>

<p>Fortunately, in my absence my wife struck up a conversation with #9, a young university student from China, and we got the actual story.</p>

<p>Turns out similar lines were stationed at every outlet an Issey Miyake Bao Bao bag would go on sale, and almost all of them were professionals.  They were doing the legwork to purchase bags and would then sell them to someone who would immediately flip them at a huge markup in China.  This is how some people were making a living (#9 just earning a bit of cash during school), such were the spoils from the trade.  Different bags were worth different amounts but because there was no warning of what bags would land at what stores it was total luck of the draw each and every day.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>We’d really stumbled onto something here.  We wondered if my mother-in-law’s bag had been such a hassle to get.  That certainly wasn’t part of the narrative, and she’d had it a while so demand might have been very different.  But neither the Japanese colleague nor his Japanese wife would have dared to let on even if it had been this involved, so we’d never know for sure.</p>

<p>Let me tell you the hours just flew by, such was the anticipation of what we were about to witness.  I knew enough to know that this little exercise in Japan was not going to go down like an American Black Friday sale.  No running, certainly no pushing and I was positive the order people were in line would be the precise order they were served.</p>

<p>Friends, I was not disappointed!</p>

<p>At 9:45am an Issey Miyake sales assistant, accompanied by a department store representative came down to fill us in.  It was clear this was by now standard operating procedure, and I suspect we might have been the only ones there hearing it all for the first time:</p>
<p>In a few moments we would be escorted into the department store before official opening</p>
<p>Please stay together and in single file</p>
<p>There was a limit of two bags per person</p>
<p>There were only 26 bags today!</p>

<p>Spot #11...guaranteed there would be at least 6 bags available...but would they be good ones?  The tension was mounting.</p>

<p>At 9:50am the rope came off the front of the line for the march.  We’d made it clear to everyone in line already that though we were standing together I was not “in line”, and with a few quick hand signs the officials understood that as well so we walked in together, figuring at some point she’d be on her own.</p>

<p>We snaked through the near-empty department store, only employees making last minute adjustments to stock or counters, or already at their places ready for opening.</p>

<p>The inside line made the outside line look cheap and hastily slapped together.</p>

<p>We were met with a proper rope maze to hold as many customers as might possibly turn up.  I did not enter that line, I ducked off to the side where I had a ring-side-seat to the action. Then each individual was given a slip of paper with their position number on it.</p>

<p>They weren’t messing around.</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with little brand sections on department store floors there’s usually just a few shelves or racks, some manner of signage and if it’s big enough or fancy enough it’ll have a little counter, perhaps a cabinet or small storage room just for that brand.  Aside from that it’s pretty free-flowing with the rest of the space.  But not this morning.</p>

<p>Along with the ropes that made the line maze they had also sealed off the Issey Miyake space so there was ONE entrance and ONE exit, past the cash register.</p>

<p>We then watched as the assistants brought out the bags and put them on display, which was fascinating.  It was clear that almost none of these would be around for more than 10 minutes (finally clearing up what the hell was going on yesterday with empty shelves) and yet they were being properly displayed in the aesthetically appropriate spaces per the manager’s direction.</p>

<p>Then at 10am sharp the department store opened and the first person in line was allowed in, by himself, to make his selection and purchase.  Then #2 and so on.  They completed one person’s transaction completely and they left the enclosure before the next would go in, but everyone in line could see everything so there wasn’t much dilly-dallying.</p>

<p>There were only about 8 different styles on display, duplicates staying in the store room.  If someone selected a bag with a version in the store room they would go get that wrapped bag to sell.  But if it was the last of its kind then it came off the shelf.  I’m not sure I can convey here the tension in that line, with every selection, would it come off the shelf?  Relief if it didn’t, a crescendo of anticipation crashing into disappointment if it did.</p>

<p>It was at this point that my wife had some decisions to make, and fast.  Would she buy the best of what was left, no matter what it was, so she walked away with something?  Would she hold her standards and if something she liked was available then great, and if not it was an interesting morning?  We hadn’t even begun to think about possibly doing this all again the next day.</p>

<p>By about #7, with bag styles dropping like flies, #9 declared that she wasn’t interested in anything that was left; all the professionals knew what each was worth so she recognised there wasn’t enough margin out there.  But did my wife have a preference that might still be available (that #10 might snatch) that she could buy and we’d pay her back?  This was a time-pressure decision that my wife wasn’t quite prepared for.  To say nothing of the style/cost decision, that then entangled us with paying for the bag in cash, getting said cash and so forth...certainly more hassle than just buying from the shop with the credit card.</p>

<p>Fortunately #10 saw the writing was on the wall and bailed.  Which meant that after #8 my wife went in to make her selection.  I was hoping this wouldn’t be the moment the credit card decided to have a problem.  There were still a few legitimately in line and there was also now a crowd of onlookers observing the spectacle that was the Issey Miyake counter.</p>

<p>We were young enough that the price of the bags, while certainly not eye-watering, was a point to consider...but we couldn’t worry about that now.  She liked the look of two of the remaining bags, so she got them.  The card worked smoothly…</p>

<p>Success!!!</p>

<p>This hadn’t all built up enough for there to be tears or real elation, but we had a good feeling heading into the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The rest of the trip was a blur, but a delightful one I’m sure.</p>

<p>I’m also happy to report that using our hard-won knowledge a few days later at an Issey Miyake shop at the airport.  With a reasonably early flight booked we only needed to arrive about two hours earlier than we would have otherwise to get into line for the airport location and snag another bag.</p>

<p>And I’m delighted to report all three bags see use to this day, with one being in heavy rotation.</p>
