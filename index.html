  <h1 style="text-align: center;">What has Dru been up to?</h1>

  <p>I've been tinkering with html and other coding recently and thought I should set up a website to post a few things that would bring everyone up to speed on what's been up with me.</p>

  <h2>The Family</h2>

  <p>Below you'll find links to some info and autobiographical stories I wrote a little while back for fun.  This seems as good a spot to put them as any so at least they'll be read by a few people.  Also The Timeline is a quick summary of what's been up since 1999.  Plus I've popped several of the Christmas cards I do most years that have a few pictures and notes about life envents.</p>
