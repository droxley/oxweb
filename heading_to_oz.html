<p>I’m sometimes struck by the idea of the relative ratios of the size of a thing with the size of the impact that it has on a person’s life or perhaps the trajectory of human civilization!</p>

<p>It remains to be seen if I’ll have any impact on human civilization, but certainly some of the fateful moments of my life have turned on very minor things indeed.  Or as it would turn out on several minor things!</p>

<p>Let’s jump back to early in my 3rd year (Junior year for any State-siders playing at home) at the Illinois Institute of Technology.  I was pretty carefree at the time.  I was very settled into college life: the 2nd Fowler crew was mostly unchanged so not many surprises on floor-mates, sticking with the same roommate, the Civil Engineering majors had coalesced into a few groups and we all knew each other, the radio show was rolling along and things were pretty good.</p>

<p>At some stage, and I swear this is how I remember it, I left class late one morning and while heading back to the dorm for lunch I ran into a friend or two who informed me they were on their way to a Foreign Exchange info session with free pizza.</p>

<p>FREE</p>

<p>PIZZA</p>

<p>Needless to say I didn’t go to the dorm for lunch.</p>

<p>I remember listening to the talk, including some returned students relating their positive experiences (one of whom I did some of the theatre shows with) and found myself thinking that maybe a semester abroad would be a pretty neat experience.</p>

<p>As illustrated by the Star Wars stories, if I have a crazy idea that takes hold it’s pretty much going to happen.</p>

<p>This was going to be a crazy idea!</p>

<p>I should pause to explain the nuts-and-bolts of the IIT exchange/abroad setup of the early 2000’s.  The Exchange program was an actual exchange of students.  There was a university in France (I don’t remember where, but I recall they taught in English) that had worked with IIT to match all their courses and they had a streamlined program where students could go study for a semester and class results would count towards your IIT GPA.</p>

<p>While chatting with the study abroad office (which I think was two people at the time, maybe it still is) I learned of the Study Abroad program that was a much looser affair.  A student would nominate a school to go study at, do the legwork to match classes and get signoff by their supervisor that such-and-such class over in Italy would receive a 3rd year concrete design class credit so you could still graduate with your engineering degree from IIT.  The upshot was that only a local passing grade was required and it would not have any impact on the IIT GPA.</p>

<p>My thinking, misguided or not, was thusly:<br>
-Studying in a non-English speaking country at an instruction-in-English school, especially one with dedicated exchange programs with US schools, was a great way to ensure I hung out with Americans in Europe*…lame<br>
-Going somewhere for a semester pretty much guaranteed a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it experience as a single semester flies by (between finding your feet for a few weeks, studying for finals then getting packed and back home)…also lame</p>

<p>So the logical conclusions from that were that I should study away from IIT for my entire 4th year (at the time it was structured to be my final year of a Civil Engineering degree), and it should be under the Study Abroad model.</p>

<p>*I realise I would have met plenty of locals but the ease and comfort of sticking with the other exchange students would have made it a diabolical trap</p>

<p>The original idea in my head was to target Italy, take a crash course in Italian, study in Italian, possibly fail most everything but still wrap up the Civil Engineering degree upon my return.</p>

<p>I ran that past my supervisor and while he agreed with the general sentiment he had two fateful things to say:<br>
1) The school much prefers your last year is undertaken in Chicago, at least the last semester (apparently most exchange/abroad study is a semester of 2nd year, maybe 3rd…I must have missed the meetings those years)<br>
2) If 1 holds then you’ll be back for part of a 5th year, with a full 5th year and some strategic class choices, I could get a degree in both Civil Engineering AND Architectural Engineering (at the time there was a lot of overlap between them in the course requirements handbook)</p>

<p>Now I liked architectural engineering (think acoustics and lighting) and because I was having a ball at school the prospect of a 5th year didn’t put me off.</p>

<p>But to pull that off I needed to take real engineering classes and actually pass them.</p>

<p>Studying in Italian was out.</p>

<p>I needed to study in English.</p>

<p>But not wanting to study in English in a non-English speaking country I adjusted my search for a location…</p>

<p>Canada - not far enough, and cold, possibly even colder than Chicago, no way</p>

<p>Scotland - some brilliant engineering schools, not warm</p>

<p>Australia - now we may be talking!</p>

<p>I should also step back, especially for anyone born after 2000: the web presence of Universities wasn’t then what it is now.  I was emailing, calling AND FAXING schools to get class lists and descriptions.  Remember I, myself, had to prove I was taking classes that would fit the required gaps my transcript still had.  Fortunately I had two things going for me:<br>
1) engineers writing class descriptions have very little imagination, it’s all by the book without flair or pizazz, if it’s the second class about steel anywhere in the world it’s basically the same class as every other 2nd steel class everywhere else in the world<br>
2) If I could match a few words between IIT’s class description and the other school’s then my supervisor was pretty comfortable saying “yep, that’ll count”</p>

<p>Based on what I could find I focused on two Australian schools: James Cook University in Townsville, and Melbourne University in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Now I had heard of Melbourne (as a kid we stopped in Sydney during a stopover from New Zealand to home at the time in Jakarta, Indonesia) but hadn’t been there.  I’m not sure I’d ever even heard of Queensland, let alone Townsville.</p>

<p>With that name recognition and the wide class offerings, plus some family friends that had lived in Melbourne for a bit and spoke very highly of it, I focused on Melbourne Uni to do this thing.</p>

<p>Yes, I went to Melbourne to get away from the cold.  Australians think that’s just about the dumbest move you can make…but very few Australians have been to Chicago in the winter.</p>

<p>So through the 2nd semester of year 3 I was busy getting accepted to Melbourne Uni for a year as a study abroad student (in actual fact they saw me as a Full Fee Paying International Student…everything else about me was irrelevant, I was welcomed with open arms).</p>

<p>This was a time where a few more little decisions would have an out-sized impact on my life.</p>

<p>I needed to pick a place to live.  They don’t have dorms in Australia the way I was used to but they had a semi-equivalent in Residential Colleges.  Among the faxed forms I got was one that had a list of colleges I could apply to live at (most had some spots for Full Fee Paying International Students so I just had to pick).  But it was just a list of names, even less of a web presence for these places. To name a few:<br>
<br>
Trinity College<br>
University College<br>
Queen’s College<br>
Whitley College<br>
International House<br>
Ormond College<br>
Newman College<br></p>

<p>“Well, when I’m there I’ll be international” I thought…International House, tick.</p>

<p>As the school year waned it was starting to get more and more exciting.  I lined up classes for my first Australian semester and got them cleared with my supervisor.  I was doing some philosophy classes with Prof. Snapper (there are a few stories there too) and so I opted to take some in Melbourne to tack on a Minor in Philosophy to my degrees.</p>

<p>I did take a small detour to catch Star Wars: Episode II, and then before I knew it it was almost time to fly.</p>

<p>Immediately before flying though there was the teensy task of PACKING UP MY CHILDHOOD BECAUSE MY PARENTS WERE MOVING TO HOUSTON!!!</p>

<p>Sorry, that got dramatic.</p>

<p>After finishing high school my Dad took a package to leave Mobil as they were merging with Exxon.  He ended up working in Houston, commuting down and back once a week.  My departure coincided with my brother graduating high school and with his departure for college my parents moved down to Houston.  As it happened, moving day was about a week before I flew out to Oz.</p>

<p>I had a lot of things to get rid of, and the rest pretty indiscriminately went into boxes (which I would subsequently deal with in 2013).  And amongst that I had to keep in the back of my mind what I needed to take to Melbourne, which admittedly wasn’t much.</p>

<p>I had also purchased my tickets to Melbourne months before so I was flying out of (and back into) DFW so after a week in Houston doing a bit of unboxing and then Aus-packing, we hopped in the car for the drive back to Dallas and I was on the plane bound for the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>My trip actually took me first to Auckland, New Zealand for a few days to see the sights and combat a bit of jet lag.  I don’t remember much but I wandered around a lot and saw some movies.  I also remember the hostel room where I was staying being pretty chilly.  The only other resident I recall was an interesting older gentleman (maybe late 50’s) who travelled around.  Wish I’d gotten an email address or something to keep in touch with him.</p>

<p>And then I was in Melbourne.</p>

<p>I arrived at International House late in the evening…I’m guessing it was Sunday, July 28th 2002.</p>

<p>The one clear memory I have was being amazed at the magnetic tab keys they used, shaped like military dog tags.</p>

<p>After a good night’s sleep on my college issued sheets (courtesy of a box I ticked on my faxed form) and a shower with my college supplied towel (also from a tick box on the faxed form), I embarked on the Melbourne Welcome.</p>

<p>Melbourne Welcome was a weeklong program run for the exchange students in the week before the start of the semester.  For all us American students we were “starting our school year” being on an August-May schedule, everyone else was hitting the second half of the year.</p>

<p>A few of the 2nd and 3rd year locals hung out with us for the week, showing us around Melbourne, teaching us how to ride a tram, tours of Melbourne University, crash course on Australian humour; that kind of thing.</p>

<p>I recall very early in the week going out with some of the gang (not all of the Melbourne Welcome group were living at IH), I think to eat at Lygon St.  Then over to, maybe University College, with a few folks…at a guess the girl that was staying at University College was Anya?  Anyway I wasn’t feeling well so I headed back to my room and crashed and best as I can piece together the next morning at breakfast I met Kirsten and a few of her friends.  I have no recollection of that meeting but she has since claimed that I was sick when we first met so that must have been it.</p>

<p>Sometime later that week there was a bush dance at IH.  Through a few of the IHers at the Melbourne Welcome I got to know Kirsten and her friends a bit better.  I remember chatting with El in the common room some evening during a party atmosphere (music on and low lighting) and it may have been that night.</p>

<p>The upshot was that Sonia, an American exchange student, was going back in a few days and the gang thought it’d be fun to go away for the weekend.  From a numbers perspective (the more going the lower the cost) they felt they had an extra spot and I got an invitation.  It wasn’t very concrete, we were maybe going to the beach or not (this being the middle of winter of course), but would I like to go?  Of course!  Where I’m from when a couple of cute girls ask you to go away for the weekend, you say yes.</p>

<p>There were eight of us lined up and it turned out we were heading to Cat’s grandma’s cottage out in the sticks…but that’ll be the next story.</p>
