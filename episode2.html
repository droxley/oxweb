<p>Off the success of my Episode I experience, I knew I’d do something similar for Episode II.  But not just similar, bigger! Better! An experience befitting the college man I’d be, reaching beyond what the high school boy could achieve.</p>

<p>Of course there would be a wait.  A tortuous 3 year gap while we waited for the film to be made.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that tortuous.  We had some great movies come out in that span, and I saw many of them with my new college buddies in Chicago.  The Matrix, Gladiator, Lord of the Rings…fantastic experiences.</p>

<p>But this is a story about Star Wars.</p>

<p>Before I get into the nuts and bolts of seeing the film, I need to provide a bit of background on my logistical situation at the time.</p>

<p>Drawing on the thread of what will become another story someday, I had three big projects in April/May of 2002:<br>
- See Episode II in style<br>
- Finish the school year<br>
- Get organized because I was going on exchange to Melbourne, Australia in July</p>

<p>I’ll back-up a step.</p>

<p>I hatched a novel plan for my 4th year of college to be undertaken Down Under.  This was an exciting prospect that I was looking forward to, but the planning dominated the tail end of that junior year.  Remember this was before internet ubiquity…I was faxing things to the other side of the world.  And receiving MAIL!</p>

<p>Anyway, finals that year ran from May 13th to May 17th.  But when did Episode II come out?</p>

<p>May 16!!! (well midnight into May 17…but still during finals week no matter how you sliced it)</p>

<p>Rats.</p>

<p>Double rats.</p>

<p>And the idea had been floated that if I could make it down to Austin, Texas, some high school buddies were going to be in line.  Possibly inspired by my 1999 exploits but I don’t ever recall asking.</p>

<p>What was I to do?</p>

<p>A clean cut, rule follower such as myself was surely destined to see the movie in Chicago like everyone else would have…
No!  There had to be a way.</p>

<p>And I found it…</p>

<p>“Gee professor, with all the prep I need to do before departing for Australia, is it possible I can take my exam early so I can leave the weekend before finals?”</p>

<p>Yes, that was my pitch.  Yes, it worked.  So long as I had projects done and other assorted assignments completed I would be able to take my final exams early.</p>

<p>As a studious, trustworthy student I was given the leeway I needed to go dress up as a Jedi in front of a movie theatre.</p>

<p>Bless you IIT!</p>

<p>With that locked in it was a busy last few weeks as I needed to be ready to move out, get all the assignments done, do a bit of studying and take the finals.  I don’t remember much, but I have a distinct recollection of my roommate at the time remarking, as a few of us were hanging out in our room while I was packing and dismantling the desk platforms Larry and I built, that he didn’t even realize I was taking everything apart until he noticed mid-conversation that the sofa was back on the floor all of a sudden.</p>

<p>Anyway, watches synchronized with the team in Austin, after much travel and only a very brief stop in Dallas before setting off south again in my red SAAB 900, I arrived at the Metropolitan Theatre in Austin, Texas…very late at night, call it about 1am on Tuesday May 14th.  Approximately 72 hours before first showtime!</p>

<p>With Philip and Brian on the scene the tent was taking shape so I pitched in to help complete setup.  I should note that both Philip and Brian:<br>
1. Lived in Austin, with real beds and everything, and<br>
2. Hadn’t finished their school year yet (not quite as sneaky…er, dedicated as I was…that or they had much more diligent professors that wouldn’t let them get away with this much)<br>
So with 1 and 2 being true they weren’t staying 24 hours a day like I was, they would come and go a bit but were cemented there near the front of the line.</p>

<p>Me?  I had nowhere else to go.  They would be my link to the outside world, food and drink wise.  And toys/entertainment.  And Philip sorted out and bankrolled the purchase of my 4 tickets across opening day (as I’d had so much fun doing it that way for Episode 1).</p>

<p>It was a very exciting night/morning.  A warm Texas night in May, slight breeze.  Philip went home to get some sleep before class so Brian and I played a bit of frisbee in the big, empty parking lot.</p>

<p>Then we got the lightsaber out and from increasing distances would parry and deflect incoming frisbee shots (which admittedly had a bit of a Tron feel to it).  We were giddy with excitement and hyped up on the pure sugar that was the only type of food we had with us.</p>

<p>At one point, call it 3am, a car arrived.  It was going slow, possibly intrigued by the fact there was a frisbee/lightsaber game going on.  They pulled up to find out what we were doing.  We initially thought they might be unhappy that we were there, but no!  Turns out they were part of a group that was in line at another theatre and because there wasn’t much to do they decided to do a tour of other theatres to see if other lines were in place yet.  I like to think upon their return some lightsaber training via frisbee was undertaken but I have no way to know.</p>

<p>The sugar and excitement started to wane by 4 or 5 and so we tried to get some sleep (not easy on the hard concrete, we weren’t exactly camping in comfort).  At something like 7am another car arrived with someone checking out the line.  Excited to find people set up he declared that he and his brother would return later that morning to join us (Tony and Andrew/Alex?).</p>

<p>It was beginning.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter we had a couple join us: “Quint and Auntie Meat”.  They were there as representatives of Ain't it Cool News (still active as I type this in 2024 at https://www.aintitcool.com/).  Which I must admit I hadn’t heard of. I was not generally plugged into much of the media-cultural-following scene, and am staunchly anti-spoilers so coverage of leaks or early footage didn’t and doesn’t interest me.  But they were a lovely addition to the line!</p>

<p>At some point late morning a manager came out to have a talk with us.  If we were going to be camping next to the theatre for a few days there would need to be rules:<br>
- Don’t bother anybody there to see other movies<br>
- Keep the line/camp in the designated area<br>
- Keep the line/camp area clean<br>
- We would police our order ourselves for now, later they’d come up with a way to record us to avoid issues<br>
- Unless our number hit a certain level there wouldn’t be a port-a-potty provided, during opening hours we could use the facilities inside, outside hours wasn’t his problem and the less he knew the better</p>

<p>It all seemed reasonable to us.  We were having a grand ol’ time swapping stories of seeing Episode I, seeing the original trilogy, playing Star Wars trivial pursuit (not much of a challenge) or Star Wars Monopoly…and of course fielding questions from passers by on what in the world we were doing!</p>

<p>I wish I could remember the details, but at one point Tony regaled us with an epic tale of finding a loophole of buying a certain video game at one store that had it on sale (or they had a coupon or something) and turning around to return it to another store (same chain I think) for a ‘full refund’ which netted him a few bucks…so his buddies spent an entire weekend maximizing the profits from that endeavor.  It was a great story and he told it brilliantly.</p>

<p>Being in a line of Star Wars nerds, and movie nerds, you can bet there’s some pretty cool memorabilia in everyone’s collections.  This line was no exception.  I forget who, but somehow it came up that someone had an original 35mm print of The Empire Strikes Back.  And someone else was good buddies with the guy that ran the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema.  One thing led to another and we had booked a line field trip to go see Empire at about 2am Wednesday night.  Free entry but they wanted everyone to spend money on food and drinks.  Easy!</p>

<p>By this stage the theatre had a security guard hanging around the line at all times, so we just let him know we were going to see a movie, please watch our stuff and we’ll be back in a few hours.</p>

<p>Having grown up with a VHS of the original release, and not being wild about some of the Special Edition updates a few years prior, it was absolutely brilliant to see the original Empire on the big screen for the first time.  They even had an original 1983 Return of the Jedi trailer to show beforehand.</p>

<p>Looking back, that was actually the pinnacle of my big-screen Star Wars experiences as far as seeing a movie is concerned.  The fact that it happened while waiting to see Episode II is a big part of why I’m writing the whole Episode II story down.</p>

<p>Even going to sleep that last night saw the line at pretty much this small core group of nine or ten.  I figured we’d see steady growth the whole time but the handful of us broke the curve.</p>

<p>Some other fun things happened here and there.  One Metropolitan manager took a liking to our motley crew and brought donuts once or twice.  We were also treated to non-functional membership cards that had sequential numbering as our mechanism of declaring the official order of the front of the line.</p>

<p>Excitement really started to mount about 6am the morning of, so 18 hours until the midnight first showing.</p>

<p>With the Texas sun up bright and early no matter how late we were up it was tough to sleep in so we heard the arrival of a vehicle that turned out to be a local news crew.  It was for one of the news channels that ran the same news block throughout the day.  I threw on my jedi costume, and as I recall Tony had a jedi robe and some Yoda ears, and we gave a short little interview.</p>

<p>Being the final day part of the morning involved breaking down camp so we could turn ourselves into a proper line.  And there I was, Spot #1 in full jedi costume!</p>

<p>The build up to entering the theatre is a blur.  From about noon, and even more so as school and work wrapped up the line swelled and started to wrap around the building.  To the best of my recollection, most every screen had Episode II on it but there was one official 12:01am screening and every other one would start at 12:10am.  Two upshots were: a) we’d be first, and b) you could hear some loud parts and track where the theatre next door was in the film…so that was neat.</p>

<p>Later in the evening the founder and Main Guy of Aint It Cool News, Harry Knowles, arrived as Quint and Auntie Meat were saving him a spot.  As I mentioned earlier I didn’t know the site or him, said a brief hello, but if you have a look at the start of his review down below, this kid from Chicago gets a mention!  Though I don’t recall any mention of R2 it was and is neat to see an actual, objective, record that it all happened!</p>

<p>Anyway, we got in, got the seats we wanted, and watched Episode II!</p>

<p>It was a great experience.  Leaving aside some quibbles I have with it, seeing it on the big screen was fantastic.  I wouldn’t want to spoil it but Yoda towards the end absolutely brought the house down!</p>

<p>So we filed out, still amped up we milled around chatting and slowly everyone headed home.</p>

<p>Except for me.</p>

<p>I slept in the car because I had a morning show to attend.</p>

<p>Like with Episode I, I had three more shows spaced out across opening day for a total of 4 viewings.  Say the first was at 9am and then something like 3pm and 7pm.  Very civilized, a bite to eat at lunch after a breakfast of popcorn then a late supper after the last viewing.</p>

<p>It turns out hanging around a theater most of the week AND being in full costume afforded me certain…shall we say, wandering privileges around the theater and amongst the lines.  On the basis that I wasn’t sneaking in anywhere (and why would I, I already had tickets to multiple showings) I could go anywhere and the staff were cool with it.  Even patrons in line would see me walking around chatting with people in full costume so I was more of an attraction.</p>

<p>After the 2nd showing I was wandering around because I knew Tony and his brother had tickets to a noon-ish showing.  I found them in the middle of a line someplace and we chatted about the midnight showing, and the fact that by this point I’d already seen it again.  Then the bomb gets dropped that they had another ticket for a friend that couldn’t make it…want to see it a 5th time today?  Why yes, yes I would.  So in I went for viewing #3.</p>

<p>As I recall the timing I more-or-less walked out of that one and bypassing some of the line went straight back into my pre-arranged 3pm show.</p>

<p>Philip and Brian of course caught midnight but then had things to do during the day so it was only while I was in the theatre that they arrived to get in line for 7pm along with other friends.  I got the scoop which line was for that showing from the staff then found my way to them, giddy to explain that I got an unexpected viewing under my belt.</p>

<p>Then Philip hit me with the news: “then you’re going to see it SIX times today because I got you a ticket for 11pm!”</p>

<p>To be perfectly honest those last two viewing started to become an out of body experience.  Between so much exposure to the movie, sleep deprivation and running on popcorn I wasn’t as sharp and having the plot and much more detail memorized certainly allowed my mind to wander…but to where I have no recollection.</p>

<p>Following the odyssey I crashed at Philip’s place for a loooong sleep.  And when the weekend rolled around I caught his graduation (knocked out his degree in three years!), which was great to be around for.</p>

<p>Thinking maybe I’d be in the workforce by the time Episode III rolled around I didn’t immediately have designs on another epic adventure.  As it turns out I just saw it in Melbourne, Australia on opening day.  No fanfare, no costume (not sure if I would have worn it even if I had it with me in the same country), just a guy seeing a movie…</p>

<p>But a guy that had 10 previous theatrical prequel trilogy viewings under his belt…all within 48 hours!</p>
