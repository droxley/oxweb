     <h1>Good rules for BJJ training:</h1>
<br>
<p>When on the mat, wear a mouth guard, even when warming up or drilling.</p>
<br>
<p>When coach says "mouth guards in" that's when you put on headgear.</p>

<p>My wife had wanted one for a while. Her dad’s colleague’s Japanese wife had gotten one for her mom and it was amazing. The height of fashion. The epitome of chic. We were in the homeland, the neighbourhood, the proverbial “back yard”...so we were on a mission. Well she was, I didn’t have much else to do.</p>

<p>We were after a bag.</p>

<p>Just a handbag.</p>

<p>But not just a handbag, a Bao Bao bag. I’ll back up and explain.</p>

<p>Issey Miyake is a Japanese designer and, among other things, he designed this bag. Or rather this bag style. It comes in a range of colors and shapes but the common thread is that they are put together with little triangles of plastic, glued to a plastic mesh with small gaps between them so the bags can sit tastefully crumpled when at rest. At least that’s how it was explained to me, I never did take much notice of it.</p>
