<p>As far back as I can remember I’ve been a fan of Star Wars.</p>

<p>Well that’s not quite true, I can actually remember the first time I ever saw Star Wars (note: I’m not going to call it A New Hope or Episode IV here, for almost 20 years I called it Star Wars before I had need to call it anything else so that’s what I’ve stuck with ever since), it was at my 8th birthday party.  I don’t really remember much from the movie that viewing, I mostly vaguely recall the gang getting backwards into their sleeping bags, hopping around unseeing and crashing into each other.</p>

<p>But I do remember that on my second viewing, when I was actually just sitting watching the movie I had the thought that I didn’t remember the trash compactor scene.  I blamed it on the sleeping-bag-hopping.</p>

<p>I also have a vivid memory of watching Return of the Jedi while a babysitter was looking after us.  It sticks in my mind because I ate a lot of pizza that night watching Jabba and the Ewoks and I got really sick.  The illness didn’t have anything to do with the pizza itself as I was sick for a few days afterwards.</p>

<p>And I recall staying at a friend’s house because I was getting a lift to a soccer tournament (his mom was the coach).  We stayed up far later than we should have watching the Ewok films.</p>

<p>When I was 9 we moved to Jakarta, Indonesia.  We didn’t have an antenna hooked up at our house so all we could watch were VHS tapes.  Fortunately my parents came prepared, and among the range of tapes we brought was the Star Wars trilogy…and we watched the hell out of it.  Including several back-to-back-to-back viewing experiences.</p>

<p>I had missed the heyday of the toys so didn’t really have any action figures to speak of, but I watched the movies more times than I can count.</p>

<p>And then suddenly in the late nineties Star Wars was coming back to the big screen!</p>

<p>I was there with many high school friends for opening night viewings of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  I was mildly amused with some of the Special Edition updates, but much preferred the originals I had grown up with (and memorized).</p>

<p>*I will briefly rant here that I didn’t care for seeing Jabba in Star Wars.  Seeing a casual conversation between him and Han totally deflates the tension for two whole movies that Jabba is out to get Han.  I also prefer the original ending of Return of the Jedi.  We the audience only had little hints that there was a wider world out there, suddenly seeing shots of places we have no relationship with never resonated with me.  Also this is the second Death Star they blew up and I refuse to believe the news that The Emperor died and that was going to dismantle the entire Empire’s evil reign could spread that quickly.  The small band we’d been following with their furry pals celebrating locally (including the original song) makes complete sense.  And Luke should see Old Anakin!*</p>

<p>So with that as a backdrop I was very excited by the prospect of seeing Episode I!  A brand new Star Wars movie that I could see for the first time in the theatre.  This needed to be big!</p>

<p>It was a much different digital landscape back in early/mid 1999.  I can’t remember how I first heard, months before the movie’s release, that a line had started in New York.  But I do remember thinking that was just about the best use of someone’s time as there could be.  Having high school commitments like class and such I knew I couldn’t go that big, but I could flirt with the idea.</p>

<p>The first two orders of business to attend to were:<br>
1) Get tickets<br>
2) Make costume</p>

<p>On the ticket front, the word from several friends who worked at the movie theatre (Tinseltown in Grapevine, Tx for those playing along at home) was that tickets would go on sale in the afternoon a week before the opening.  To ensure I could absorb as much Episode I-ness as possible this was where I needed to strike first.</p>

<p>As I write this in 2024, I feel the need for a quick side note…back in the 90’s you couldn’t buy tickets online.  You couldn’t buy much of anything online yet.  You had to physically present yourself at a theatre and purchase a ticket.  And while I can’t speak for other places in the world at the time, in Texas you couldn’t purchase a particular seat, just a ticket to get into the theatre.  This made lining up a key strategic element to maximize the viewing experience, but more on that later.</p>

<p>So to do this properly I would need to miss school to buy tickets at or close to when they went on sale.  Late in my senior year, as a good kid all the teachers liked…no problem.  I’m not sure I would have admitted it to the administration but all my teachers I leveled with thought it was great.  As I laid out my plan for my parents they were also supportive.  I’ve never asked, maybe they had hoped I’d be skipping school to get tickets to see a cool band, but I guess Star Wars was an acceptable second.</p>

<p>The plan was this (to the best of my recollection of dates):<br>
1) Finish school on the afternoon of Tuesday May 11th<br>
2) Drive to Tinseltown<br>
3) Get in line<br>
4) Stay in line all night<br>
5) Purchase as many tickets as I could the afternoon of Wednesday May 12th</p>

<p>And so that’s what I did.  Not much in the way of supplies, just a green jacket really.</p>

<p>I hadn’t really considered what I’d do if I was the only one there, but fortunately there were already some folks in line.  There wasn’t a sign or anything but a group of young adults sitting vaguely in a line off to the side, with the first one sitting in an inflatable Darth Maul chair…these were my people.</p>

<p>Turns out they all knew each other as most of the cast of a local production of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I don’t remember too much of any given conversation but I recall having a pleasant time with everyone.  They were all a bit older than me and impressed some high schooler was going to sleep rough at the movie theatre and skip class for Star Wars tickets.</p>

<p>Late spring in North Texas isn’t a challenging climate so aside from sleeping on concrete and not getting much sleep just because we were up talking all night it was a pretty successful evening.</p>

<p>Things got a bit more interesting as late morning rolled around because as more people were joining the line in the daylight that’s when the local reporters started turning up. Primarily they were interviewing the cast ringleader and first person in line.  But given all the reporting out of New York months earlier when that line started it was pretty neat that we were involved in a news-worthy story here in our own backyard.</p>

<p>As it rolled around to purchasing time the managers explained the rules:<br>
1) Ticket purchases would be limited, I don’t remember exactly but let’s say it was 10 per person, spread across whichever showings you wanted<br>
2) Student discounts would require one student ID per ticket per show, buy 10 for the midnight premiere and if you only had one ID then only one would be at a discount, the other 9 were full price<br>
3) Two box office windows would be operating for Star Wars tickets and a manager would send us one at a time from the official Star Wars line to a  free window to keep things orderly</p>

<p>Excitement mounted as we got closer to time.  Soon we would have tickets in our hands!  Everyone I was associated with was so far near the front any tickets we wanted were guaranteed to be available so we had no nerves on that front.  We were looking forward to both getting tickets and leaving the line for food and a shower!</p>

<p>Ticket time finally rolled around!</p>

<p>The local news got some footage and photos of the first tickets being purchased to a round of applause.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, a friend of mine’s girlfriend was my ticket salesperson.  I didn’t know her well but we recognized each other and with a slip of her finger I got all 10 of my tickets at the discounted student rate!  The force was indeed on my side.</p>

<p>I was about the 7th person in line so no one needed any pictures of me with my tickets so I was free from Phase 1 of the exercise…there was a lot to finalize over the coming week.</p>

<p>Now of course anyone can get in line for a movie.  And most anyone can wait in line for many hours for tickets to said movie.  But how many people can wait in line for hours while in a costume inspired by said movie?  Through my research I’d say not many…but when I decide something will be fun/cool/neat to do, by gum I follow through and do it! (someday I’ll submit into evidence my A-kon costumes or my trip to Australia)</p>

<p>While I have always lived by a spoiler-free policy, viewing official trailers and the resulting knowledge of the officially published media meant I had no trouble using proper Episode I references to design my Jedi costume.</p>

<p>My mom helped me source fabric (beige cloth for the pants and shirt/jacket, a dark brown table cloth became the robe) and sew things properly.  My dad gave me thumbs up/thumbs down on random things in the garage that could become a lightsaber handle (going more for a Luke Skywalker-era look).  And I recalled a kid at school wearing some boots that would fit so I asked if I could borrow them…didn’t know him well, can’t remember his name at all, though I have a vague recollection that I asked in Chemistry class.</p>

<p>With everything coming together the time was nearing.  Excitement was building.</p>

<p>I worked out my timing, which was essentially to leave school as early as possible, get dressed and go to the theatre a solid 8 or 9 hours before the midnight showing.</p>

<p>Most of the evening itself is a blur.  I was right up near the front of the line and one of the few in costume.  In fact I was pulled out of the line to be in the background shots for the reporters on the scene.  There was also a girl dressed up as Jabba’s Palace bikini Leah so we were asked to mill around together for various shots.</p>

<p>I knew a bunch of people in line and as a costumed individual I could pretty much wander around because it was universally agreed that I was really in line at such-and-such spot.  This was a powerful lesson I learned well.</p>

<p>Movie time finally came and it was fantastic.  The crowd was pumped and having such a good time.  The Dual of the Fates sequence in the theatre for the first time was especially thrilling.</p>

<p>I had my quibbles with the film but now isn’t really the time to go into them…I should write them down sometime though.</p>

<p>The sequence of events following the midnight showing are what really set this little story apart from any similar tales you might have heard.</p>

<p>So the midnight show, accounting for chatting with people and everything, more-or-less took me through to about 3am.  Now I already had my ticket purchased for the 9am showing a mere six hours later so there was another little campout, but not in a line, just in my car.  I joined the sparse line still in full jedi costume and watched it all over again!  Then I walked out of the theatre and pretty much walked right back in for the noon-ish showing.</p>

<p>Following viewing number three I took a little break and went to school in costume to say hi to a few teachers and friends, mostly hanging out in the theatre department room.  That I’d seen it already didn’t surprise anyone, I was a nerd in a jedi costume after all.  That I’d already seen it 3 times did shock people…I like to think in a “wow, I’m really impressed” kind of way, but I never asked.</p>

<p>A lot of friends who weren’t hardcore fans like me were seeing it for the first time around 7pm that night, which was the showing for my last ticket (many of them using requested tickets I’d bought for them…and yes, I did pass on the discount I’d received).</p>

<p>It was a wonderful experience because I’d already memorized the movie so I just soaked in the moment and tried to take in everything else going on in the frame.  In some ways it was similar to seeing the original trilogy two years before.</p>

<p>The whole experience was so positive I was looking forward to taking the same route for Episode II.  In fact I went even further…but that’s another story!</p>
